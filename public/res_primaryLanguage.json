      "description": "Hello, my name is Sheldon Pierce. I am a Software Developer from Chicago. I recently moved to Seattle with a job as a Hydrogeologist but quickly realized where my true passions were. I like to snowboard and hike like most people from the PNW. My journey into technology started when I was very young, but very recently I fell in love with coding. I've been teaching myself during the last year, but I felt like it was time to get a little more structure that a bootcamp like Code Fellows offers. I look forward to my career in Software Development and working on amazing projects!",
