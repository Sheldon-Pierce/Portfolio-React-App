      "description": "Hello, my name is Sheldon Pierce. I am originally from Chicago, but I recently moved to Seattle as a Hydrologist. During my career as a Hydrologist, I used SQL and databases to keep track of legacy groundwater data for different clients, as well as making python scripts in ArcGIS to gather data from maps to present to clients. During this time, I realized I actually loved coding more than I loved geology and was determined to make the switch towards this new career. I started teaching myself, and then decided to join a bootcamp for a little more structure and guidance. I love what I do now, and everyday presents a new challenge that I am ready to solve. I look forward to my career in software development and working on amazing projects with like minded individuals.",
